== Description ==

= What is LinkPizza? =

LinkPizza is an new URL shortener which uses affiliate networks to help monetize your links. Any clicks on your links will be tracked in your account (statistics and commissions are not currently visible yet but will be introduced soon).

= The plugin =
By signing up for LinkPizza and installing this plugin, your links are automatically monetized when linking to one of our implemented advertisers (30,000+). Our product is mainly aimed at the european market and already includes the major networks. If you want to check if a advertiser is supported go to linkpizza.com and check the url for dollar signs.

= Reporting = 
When you've registered your account and installed the plugin, sign in to LinkPizza.com to check your outgoing clicks and see if you installed the script correctly. The plugin doesn't include a dashboard in wordpress, but this will be implemented in a later stage.

= Commission =
LinkPizza splits the commission with you on a 20-80 base, we keep 20% of the earned commission from the advertiser and you receive the other 80%, in return we save you trouble of having to sign up for all the different networks and make sure your links keep working even when an advertiser switches networks or stops their affiliate program.

Currently LinkPizza support 9 networks with over 30,000 different advertisers
Some of the networks include: Zanox, Daisycon, Affiliate4You, Tradetracker and various loose merchants such as bol.com, wehkamp and Amazon
